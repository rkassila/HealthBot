# HealthBot

HealthBot is a chatbot interface project (in development) designed to assist patients in describing their symptoms and receiving potential diagnoses / transmitting information to their healthcare provider. 
The chatbot will perform feature extraction, cross-references symptoms with a medical database, and provide predictions for possible diseases. It will also generate reports and handle patient history and ongoing treatments.
